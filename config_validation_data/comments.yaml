Analysis:
  capture_rms_only: Improves speed, does not store or plot whole waveform
  max_standard_deviation_w: limit for the standard deviation within each interval
    for RFB test
  samples_to_remove_at_end: Samples removed from end of each on/off interval to eliminate
    transition
  settling_time_s: Duration of data removed from beginning of each on/off interval
Daq_Power_Relay:
  port: Com port, find this in device manager
Debugging:
  simulate_awg: Note that enabling this setting will show simulated data
Forward_Power_Meter:
  serial_number: Ensure this is the forward meter
Galil_Motors:
  calibrate_ray: Steps per mm or degree
  encoder_resolution_ray: Encoder counts per revolution
  gearing_ray: Gear ratio between one motor turn and one turn of the UA (for theta)
  ip_address: IP adress of the Galil on a dedicated NIC
  speeds_ray: MM/s, degrees/s
Keysight_AWG:
  identifier: Model-specific str found in the Pyvisa adrees
Reflected_Power_Meter:
  cal_fact: (Not reccomended) Value to muliply power meter readings by
  serial_number: Ensure this is the reflected meter
WTF_PositionParameters:
  CentreHomeTheta?: Causes theta homing to end on center of reflector, not edge
  ThetaHomeCoord: The coordinate defined when homing is complete
  ThetaHomeEdgeCoord: The difference between this and thetahomeedgecoord affects the
    centrehometheta move
  ThetaHydrophoneCoord: The assumed coordinate of the hydrophone in theta
  ThetaPreHomeMove: The amount the R axis will move if the home switch is already
    active
  X-Element pitch (mm): Spacing between elements
