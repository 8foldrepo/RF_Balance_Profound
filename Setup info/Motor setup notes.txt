#Arguments for the following command:
#Type – 0 to 1023 number code                                                #Found using guided drive setup for custom drive
#Current – RMS continuous motor current (0.1 to 5.6 A in 0.1 A increments    #1.2 A rated for the rotational motor
#for ViX500).
#Resolution – Any value from 200 to 51200 steps per rev.                     #4000 is default
#Max_vel 1 to 3,000 rpm                                                      #100 is a conservative figure
#Third Harmonic – % of third harmonic applied to current sine wave. Used to  #5 percent is a conservative figure
#increase slow speed smoothness. Range: +/-15%.                              
#Resistance – Winding resistance in Ohms*                                    #3.2 is given in the rotational motor datasheet
#Inductance – Winding inductance in mH*                                      #Measure this later
